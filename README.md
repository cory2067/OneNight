# OneNight
See the website in action on http://1night.online

Running this website should be as simple as `python3 server.py`

To run in development, you can change the second to last line so it isn't running on port 80.

Also, there are some required dependencies for the webserver.
`pip3 install flask`
`pip3 install gevent`
